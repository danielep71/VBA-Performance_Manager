## ✨ Overview

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Focus" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Timing %2B Runtime Control-217346">
</p>

`cPerformanceManager` is a **high-precision timing and execution-control component for Excel VBA on Windows**.

It wraps multiple timing backends behind a single, session-bound interface and adds a practical runtime-control layer for Excel automation.

The class supports:

- ⏱️ precise elapsed-time measurement
- 🧾 human-readable elapsed-time diagnostics
- 🔁 formatting of an already measured elapsed value without taking a second timing sample
- 📉 benchmark-overhead estimation
- ⏳ pause / wait helpers
- 🧱 structured checkpoints and reporting
- 🧹 shared Excel “time-waster” suppression

Importantly, the suppression features are **not limited to timed benchmarks**. They can also be used as a **general-purpose Excel/VBA performance aid** in procedures that do not measure elapsed time, reducing avoidable overhead from screen refresh, events, alerts, calculation-mode churn, and cursor updates during heavy operations.

This makes `cPerformanceManager` more than a timer utility: it is a **runtime execution controller** for structured and performance-aware VBA solutions.

---

## 🎯 Why this exists

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Problem" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Problem-VBA Timing Limits-orange">
</p>

VBA’s native timing options are often not ideal for instrumentation and benchmarking:

- ⏲️ `Timer` has limited resolution and rolls over at midnight
- 🕰️ `Now()` is wall-clock based and is not a preferred monotonic benchmark source
- 🪟 Windows exposes better monotonic and high-resolution counters, such as `QueryPerformanceCounter`

`cPerformanceManager` provides a consistent abstraction over those timing sources and complements them with execution and environment controls that are highly useful in real Excel/VBA projects.

---

## 🚀 Core capabilities

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Scope" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Scope-Timing Reporting TW-brightgreen">
</p>

- ⏱️ multiple timing methods behind one interface
- 🔒 session-bound timing model
- ⚡ low-overhead numeric elapsed-time measurement
- 🧾 human-readable elapsed-time formatting
- 🔁 formatting of an already measured elapsed value without taking a second timing sample
- 📉 benchmark-overhead measurement helpers
- 🔍 timing/source diagnostics
- ⏳ pause / wait helper
- 🧱 structured checkpoint capture within one timing session
- 📦 machine-readable checkpoint export
- 📝 human-readable checkpoint reporting
- 🧹 shared Excel “time-waster” suppression for both benchmarking and general Excel/VBA performance improvement
- 🛡️ strict-mode validation for safer usage

---

## 🧹 What are “time-wasters”?

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Control" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Control-Excel Application State-217346">
</p>

“Time-wasters” are Excel application behaviors that can degrade performance during execution, especially in heavy procedures or repeated loops.

Typical examples include:

- 🖥️ screen updating
- ⚡ event firing
- 🚨 display alerts
- 🧮 automatic calculation churn
- 🖱️ cursor state changes

`cPerformanceManager` provides centralized control over these elements so they can be suppressed during intensive procedures and restored cleanly afterward.

This is useful both for:

- 📊 cleaner benchmark runs
- 🚀 faster ordinary workbook automation, even when no elapsed-time measurement is being taken

---

## 🧱 Structured checkpoints and reporting

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Output" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Output-Array %2B Text Reports-brightgreen">
</p>

A single elapsed-time value is often not enough.

`cPerformanceManager` also supports **named checkpoints** inside a timing session so you can break a workflow into meaningful measured phases such as:

- 📥 loading data
- 🧮 building arrays
- ✍️ writing formulas
- 🔄 recalculating
- 📤 exporting results

For each checkpoint the class stores:

- 🔢 sequence number
- 🏷️ checkpoint name
- 📝 optional note
- Δ delta seconds since the previous checkpoint
- Σ cumulative elapsed seconds since `StartTimer`
- ⏱️ timing method metadata
- 🏁 optional run label

The report can then be exported as:

- 📦 a **2D array** through `ReportAsArray()`
- 📝 a **readable multiline text block** through `ReportAsText()`

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Section" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/section-quick_start-6f42c1">
  <img alt="Examples" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/examples-timing_checkpoints_tw-217346">
</p>

### 1️⃣ Basic timing (default QPC backend)

```vb
Sub Example_BasicTiming()

    Dim cPM As cPerformanceManager
    Dim ElapsedS As Double

    Set cPM = New cPerformanceManager

    cPM.StartTimer

    Range("A1:A10000").Value = 1

    ElapsedS = cPM.ElapsedSeconds
    Debug.Print "Elapsed seconds: " & Format$(ElapsedS, "0.000000000")

    cPM.ResetEnvironment
    Set cPM = Nothing

End Sub
```

### 2️⃣ Format an already measured elapsed value

```vb

## 🧹 `TW_Enum` flags

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Section" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/section-tw_enum-6f42c1">
  <img alt="Type" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/type-bitmask_flags-217346">
</p>

Use with `TW_Turn_OFF Except:=...` as bitmask flags:

- `TW_Enum.None`
- `TW_Enum.ScreenUpdating`
- `TW_Enum.EnableEvents`
- `TW_Enum.DisplayAlerts`
- `TW_Enum.Calculation`
- `TW_Enum.Cursor`

Example:

```vb
cPM.TW_Turn_OFF TW_Enum.ScreenUpdating Or TW_Enum.EnableEvents
```

---

## 🛡️ Strict mode behavior

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Section" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/section-strict_mode-6f42c1">
  <img alt="Validation" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/validation-fail_fast-orange">
</p>

- default: `StrictMode = True`
- strict mode raises on:
  - invalid timer method
  - `ElapsedSeconds` before `StartTimer`
  - explicit elapsed method mismatch versus active session
  - `SetRunLabel` after checkpoint capture has already begun
  - `Checkpoint` before `StartTimer`
- non-strict mode attempts fallback or coercion where supported

## 🧠 Design notes

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Section" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/section-design_notes-6f42c1">
  <img alt="Guidance" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/guidance-best_practices-217346">
</p>

- Prefer method `5` (`QueryPerformanceCounter`) for benchmark-grade timing
- Use `ElapsedSeconds` for numeric logic and machine-readable results
- Use `ElapsedTime` for user-facing display
- When you already have a numeric elapsed value, prefer `ElapsedTime(, ElapsedSecondsIn)` to avoid taking a second timing sample
- When you already have a numeric overhead value, prefer `OverheadMeasurement_Text(, , OverheadSecondsIn)` to avoid taking a second overhead measurement
- Use checkpoints when a workflow needs phase-level timing rather than only one final elapsed value
- Always call `ResetEnvironment` in normal flows and in error-cleanup paths
- “Time-waster” suppression is useful both for cleaner benchmarks and for improving performance in ordinary Excel/VBA procedures, even when no elapsed-time measurement is being taken
